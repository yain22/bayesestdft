\title{Perform Hierarchical Win Ratio and Functional Score Analysis}
\usage{
WR_analysis(dataset1, dataset2, dataset3)
}
\arguments{
\item{dataset1}{Data frame containing matched pairs and win indicators for the first (highest priority) layer (typically time-to-event).}

\item{dataset2}{Data frame for the second layer (e.g., hospitalization or recurrent event score).}

\item{dataset3}{Data frame for the third layer (e.g., quality-of-life or patient-reported outcomes).}
}
\value{
A named list with the following elements:
\describe{
  \item{win.losses.count.summary}{A data frame with counts and proportions of wins, ties, and losses by layer and in total.}
  \item{sample.size.summary}{Sample sizes for treatment, control, and total number of pairwise comparisons.}
  \item{FS.analysis.summary}{Test statistic, variance, z-score, and p-value for the functional score test.}
  \item{WR.analysis.summary}{Win ratio, variance estimates, confidence intervals, and p-value for the win ratio test.}
}
}
\description{
Analyzes matched treatment-control pairs across three prioritized outcome layers using a hierarchical win ratio framework.
The function computes win/loss/tie counts at each layer, win ratio test statistics, and functional score statistics as described in
Finkelstein and Schoenfeld (1999), Pocock et al. (2012), and Yu & Ganju (2022).
