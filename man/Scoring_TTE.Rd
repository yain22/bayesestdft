\title{Score Time-to-Event Pairwise Comparisons for Win Ratio}
\usage{
Scoring_TTE(dataset, var1, var2, censor1, censor2)
}
\arguments{
\item{dataset}{A data frame containing matched pairs of subjects with outcome and censoring indicators.}

\item{var1}{Character. Name of the column representing the time-to-event variable for the subject in position 1 (e.g., \code{"deathdays1"}).}

\item{var2}{Character. Name of the column representing the time-to-event variable for the subject in position 2 (e.g., \code{"deathdays2"}).}

\item{censor1}{Character. Name of the censoring indicator variable (1 = event occurred, 0 = censored) for subject 1.}

\item{censor2}{Character. Name of the censoring indicator variable for subject 2.}
}
\value{
A modified data frame identical to the input \code{dataset} but with updated values for:
\describe{
  \item{score}{Win/loss/tie indicator: 1 if subject 1 wins, -1 if subject 2 wins, NA for tie or unresolvable comparison.}
  \item{WR_cat}{Character column indicating whether subject 1 is a "winner" or "loser" due to the time-to-event outcome.}
}
}
\description{
This function assigns win/loss/tie scores to matched subject pairs based on their time-to-event outcomes
(e.g., death or other hard endpoints). It is designed to be used as the first layer in a hierarchical win ratio framework.
The scoring accounts for censoring and ties due to simultaneous or unknown outcomes.
}
\details{
\itemize{
  \item A win is declared if subject 1 survives significantly longer than subject 2.
  \item A loss is declared if subject 2 survives significantly longer than subject 1.
  \item Ties or unresolved scores occur if censoring interferes with outcome comparison or both are censored.
