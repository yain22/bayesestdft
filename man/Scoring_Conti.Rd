\title{Score Continuous Outcomes for Win Ratio Comparison}
\usage{
Scoring_Conti(dataset, higher_better, var1, var2)
}
\arguments{
\item{dataset}{A data frame containing matched subject pairs and prior win/loss indicators (i.e., column \code{score}).}

\item{higher_better}{Character. Set to \code{"Yes"} if higher values of the outcome indicate better health (e.g., QoL),
or \code{"No"} if lower values are preferred (e.g., hospitalization count).}

\item{var1}{Character. Name of the variable for subject 1 (e.g., \code{"kccq1"} or \code{"HFH_Annual1"}).}

\item{var2}{Character. Name of the variable for subject 2 (e.g., \code{"kccq2"} or \code{"HFH_Annual2"}).}
}
\value{
A modified version of the input \code{dataset}, where:
\describe{
  \item{score}{Updated to 1 (subject 1 wins), -1 (subject 2 wins), 0 (tie), or \code{NA} (missing values prevent comparison).}
  \item{WR_cat}{Updated win/loss explanation at this layer (e.g., "kccq winner").}
}
}
\description{
Assigns win/loss/tie scores to matched subject pairs based on continuous outcomes, such as hospitalization rate or quality-of-life score.
This function is typically used in the second or third layer of a hierarchical win ratio framework,
following initial scoring based on time-to-event outcomes.
}
\details{
The function only assigns scores to pairs where the current \code{score} is \code{NA} or 0,
indicating that prior layers (e.g., death) did not resolve the comparison.

A small tolerance (\eqn{10^{-10}}) is used to define ties for nearly equal values.
